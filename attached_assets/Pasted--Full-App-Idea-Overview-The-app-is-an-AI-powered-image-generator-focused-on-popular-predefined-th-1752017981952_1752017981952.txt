ðŸ“Œ Full App Idea Overview
The app is an AI-powered image generator focused on popular predefined themes from games, movies, TV shows, and special effects â€” no text input from users.

Users pick a theme from a curated list (like Minecraft, GTA, Stranger Things, etc.), and the app generates a themed image using OpenAIâ€™s image generation API.

One special theme lets users upload their own photo, which the app processes with an AI model that transforms the person in the photo into a baby version â€” while keeping the original look and details intact.

All themes and their AI prompts are managed dynamically through a secure admin panel. This lets the product team add, edit, or remove themes and prompts without developer intervention.

The whole system should be scalable, secure, and fast â€” delivering images with smooth user experience on mobile (Flutter app) and easy backend management (Supabase).

ðŸš€ Development Plan: Flutter Frontend + Supabase Backend
1. Tech Stack
Flutter: Cross-platform app (iOS & Android) with smooth UI for theme selection, image generation, photo upload, and image display.

Supabase: Backend database (PostgreSQL), authentication, storage for photos & generated images, and API hosting.

OpenAI API: For prompt-based image generation.

3rd-Party AI: For photo baby transformation (image-to-image model).

Admin Panel: Built either in Flutter Web or a web framework consuming Supabase APIs for managing themes/prompts.

2. Core User Features
User launches the app â†’ sees categories (Games, TV Shows, Baby Transformation).

User picks a category â†’ sees available themes as cards.

User taps a theme â†’ app sends the associated prompt to OpenAI â†’ displays generated image.

For baby transformation â†’ user uploads photo â†’ app sends photo to AI â†’ displays transformed baby image.

Users can save/share generated images.

Optional: user account to save history.

3. Admin Panel Features
Secure login via Supabase Auth.

Manage themes: add, edit, delete themes and their prompts dynamically.

Themes stored in Supabase database.

Changes appear instantly in the user app.

Ability to search and paginate theme list.

Tagging, categorization, and status (active/inactive) for themes.

4. Supabase Backend Setup
Database tables for themes, users, generated images.

Storage buckets for user uploads and generated images.

API endpoints or Supabase Edge Functions to:

Fetch theme lists for app.

Trigger OpenAI and baby-transformer AI calls.

Save image metadata.

Secure endpoints with authentication and validation.

5. Developer Guidelines
Flutter app connects to Supabase to fetch dynamic themes and user data.

Use Flutter widgets for responsive UI.

Admin panel is a separate app or web interface consuming the same Supabase backend.

Implement full CRUD for themes in admin.

Handle file uploads securely with Supabase Storage.

Ensure fast, reliable image generation and display.

Follow best practices for security, error handling, and scalability.
